                  <p><strong>Game Based Learning</strong></p>
                  <p>As part of the collaborative mathematics learning project, I incorporate game-based learning, which combines elements of the team games tournament model with window shopping and flipped classroom approaches. In this game-based learning environment, students participate in team games tournaments where they compete in small groups or pairs to solve math problems and explore mathematical concepts. The window shopping aspect allows students to explore different mathematical topics and resources at their own pace, while the flipped classroom model involves students engaging with instructional materials before class, enabling more interactive and hands-on learning activities during class time.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, I implement tournaments at the end of each learning session using the Quizizz application. This gamified assessment tool adds an element of competition and fun to the learning process, motivating students to review and apply their knowledge while reinforcing key mathematical concepts. Through these game-based learning strategies, students are actively engaged in collaborative and interactive learning experiences that enhance their mathematical skills and understanding.</p>
                  <p>Here is the documentation of the game-based learning instruction on the topic of the factor theorem.</p>

                  <p><strong>Inquiry-Discovery Based Learning</strong></p>
                  <p>Inquiry-discovery based learning is an instructional approach that emphasizes student-centered exploration and discovery. In this approach, students actively engage in the learning process by asking questions, conducting investigations, and making connections between concepts. Rather than receiving information passively, students are encouraged to explore and construct their own understanding of the material through hands-on activities, experiments, and problem-solving tasks.</p>
                  <p>For instance, in a lesson on identifying relations and functions, students may be presented with real-world scenarios or data sets and tasked with analyzing patterns, making predictions, and drawing conclusions about the relationships between variables. Through guided inquiry and discovery activities, students develop critical thinking skills, mathematical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the lesson, I implement a quiz using Kahoot, an interactive game-based learning platform. Kahoot allows for the creation of engaging quizzes and surveys where students can compete individually or in teams, answering questions related to the material covered. This assessment tool provides immediate feedback to students and helps reinforce learning outcomes in a fun and interactive way.</p>
